## protobufs to TypeScript
This repo translates protofiles to typescript files with matching class, class-validator and swagger decorators.
The idea is to use/extend those classes (extend with more custom decorators if needed) and to translate by hand proto files into typescript.
Some code might be broken due to propriatery packages which can be easily replaced.
